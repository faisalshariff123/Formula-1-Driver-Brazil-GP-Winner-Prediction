## Watson Analysis

The predicted winner, NOR, would win due to their high number of wins and podiums, combined with a strong average position and relatively low average lap time. Their consistency and ability to perform well across races make them a likely winner.

RUS would not win because, despite having a decent number of podiums, their average position is lower than NOR's, and their average lap time is slightly higher. While they have shown some speed with a relatively fast average fastest lap, it's not enough to overcome their overall lower performance.

VER would not win because, although they have a significant number of wins and podiums, their average position is lower than NOR's, and their average lap time is the highest among the three. Additionally, their lap variance is the lowest, which may indicate a lack of adaptability and consistency in different racing conditions.
